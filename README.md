<br>

Hi all there !<br>

Welcome to my Under-Grad Project Repository. This is a store-house of all my projects carried out during my bachelor years at **[VIT University (Vellore, TN, IND)](https://vit.ac.in/)**.

This repo will be beneficial to those (*especially to sopohomores, juniors and seniors*) who have just started getting their hands dirty to learn something practically.

> <mark>***NOTE***</mark> : Most of the project's source code is not available because I realized too late that I needed to save it for future reference. Apologies for the inconvenience ! - However, you can still gain a lot from every project's documentation(s), which is concise and should help you understand the work done.

The projects will help you gain idea about some key sub-realms of `Information Technology` and also the usage of some important tools and platforms. Below are the list of projects in this repository and a summary about them ðŸ”½

### **[Credit Card Fraud Detection System - A Comparison Study on various Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/sricks404/My-UnderGrad-Projects/tree/main/Credit%20Card%20Fraud%20Detection%20System%20-%20A%20Comparison%20Study%20on%20various%20Machine%20Learning%20and%20Deep%20Learning%20Algorithms) - Soft ComputingðŸ”»**<br>

This project aims to address the rising issue of credit card frauds using advanced soft computing and machine learning methods. As digital payments become prevalent, so does the vulnerability to fraud, necessitating robust detection systems.

Key components of the project include :
1.  <b>Objective</b> : To compare the effectiveness of different machine learning and deep learning techniques in detecting credit card fraud using datasets (such as those from Kaggle).<br>
2.  <b>Techniques Used</b> : The study evaluates 7 modules/techniquesðŸ”» <br>
	â€¢ [Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/convolutional-neural-networks)<br>
	â€¢ [Decision Tree Algorithm](https://www.ibm.com/topics/decision-trees)<br>
	â€¢ [K Nearest Neighbour (KNN)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/knn#:~:text=The%20k%2Dnearest%20neighbors%20(KNN,used%20in%20machine%20learning%20today.))<br>
	â€¢ [Support Vector Machine (SVM)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/support-vector-machine#:~:text=What%20are%20SVMs%3F,in%20an%20N%2Ddimensional%20space.)<br>
	â€¢ [NaÃ¯ve Bayes Classifier](https://www.ibm.com/topics/naive-bayes)<br>
	â€¢ [Random Forest Algorithm](https://www.ibm.com/topics/random-forest#:~:text=Random%20forest%20is%20a%20commonly,both%20classification%20and%20regression%20problems.)<br>
	â€¢ [Artificial Neural Network (ANN)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-neural-networks-and-its-applications/)<br>
	â€¢ [Confusion Matrix](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/confusion-matrix#:~:text=A%20confusion%20matrix%20represents%20the,by%20model%20as%20other%20class.)<br><br>
3.  <b>Evaluation Metrics</b> : Performance is measured using metrics such as [Accuracy, Precision, Recall (Sensitivity), and F1-score](https://klu.ai/glossary/accuracy-precision-recall-f1) to assess the models' effectiveness in fraud detection.<br>
4.  <b>Methodology</b> : The project involves training models on datasets, evaluating their performance using specified metrics, and comparing results with existing studies to determine the most efficient techniques.<br>
5.  <b>Significance</b> : Given the significant increase in credit card fraud cases globally, this research is crucial for identifying the most reliable methods for fraud detection, thereby enhancing security measures in digital transactions.

This project utilized a dataset [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) sourced from Kaggle, specifically provided by Google. This dataset contains records of approximately 284,807 transactions across European countries. Of these transactions, only 492 (0.17%) were identified as fraudulent, highlighting the imbalance between fraudulent and valid transactions. All features in the dataset are numerical, facilitating analysis using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. The 'Amount' feature represents the transaction amount and can be crucial for cost-sensitive learning, while the 'Class' feature serves as the response variable, taking the value 1 for fraud and 0 otherwise. The entire project was implemented in Python 3.9.4 within the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) [Python](https://www.python.org/) [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) environment using [Anaconda's](https://www.anaconda.com/) virtual environment. The columns labeled V1 to V28 in the dataset represent values resulting from [Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/principal-component-analysis-pca/). PCA is a method used for dimensionality reduction in datasets, originating from linear algebra. It transforms original variables into weighted linear combinations of those variables, capturing maximum variance while minimizing correlations between them. In PCA, [eigenvectors and eigenvalues](https://lpsa.swarthmore.edu/MtrxVibe/EigMat/MatrixEigen.html) derived from the covariance matrix of the original data are used to create new orthogonal components. An eigenvector of a linear transformation is a vector that changes only by a scalar factor when the transformation is applied, with the corresponding eigenvalue scaling the eigenvector. Among the models examined, `Artificial Neural Network (ANN)` achieved the `highest Accuracy` (<mark><b>99.95%</b></mark>), while `Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)` had the lowest (<mark><b>93.65%<b></mark>). `SVM` demonstrated the `highest Precision` (<mark><b>100.00%</b></mark>), and `ANN excelled in Recall` (<mark><b>99.98%</b></mark>) and `F1 Score` (<mark><b>99.97%</mark></b>). Overall, `ANN` proved to be the `most effective method`, showcasing superior performance in training, testing, and application. Future enhancements could focus on expanding datasets to further improve model accuracy, potentially reducing false positives and enhancing fraud detection capabilities significantly.

### **[Student Behavioral Analysis via Emotional Speech Recognition](https://github.com/sricks404/My-UnderGrad-Projects/blob/main/Student%20Behavioral%20Analysis%20via%20Emotional%20Speech%20Recognition%20(Machine%20Learning).pdf) - Machine Learning ðŸ”»**<br>
This project aims to analyze and predict the emotions expressed by students during their interactions with teachers in online classes. â€‹ The goal is to understand the students' understanding of the topics being taught based on their tone of speech. â€‹ The project focuses on recognizing emotions such as <i>neutral, anger, joy, and sorrow</i> from the students' spoken replies. â€‹This project follows a technical explanation path and involves several steps and techniques. â€‹ Data augmentation is used to generate fresh training examples by adding tiny perturbations to the original dataset. â€‹ Four data augmentation strategies are employed : <i><u>noise, shifting, pitch shifting, and time stretching</u></i>. â€‹ These techniques are applied to the audio data before generating [Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features](https://medium.com/@derutycsl/intuitive-understanding-of-mfccs-836d36a1f779), which are used to train the deep learning model.
