# Under-Grad Project Repository
<br>

Hi all there !<br>

Welcome to my Under-Grad Project Repository. This is a store-house of all my projects I carried out during my bachelor years at **[VIT University (Vellore, TN, IND)](https://vit.ac.in/)**.

This repo will be beneficial to those (*especially to sopohomores, juniors and seniors*) who have just started getting their hands dirty to learn something practically.

> <mark>***NOTE***</mark> : Most of the project's source codes are not available because I figured out way later than I should have that, I needed to save them for future reference. Thus, apologies in advance ! But you can still extract a lot from the project's documentation - they are pretty brief to help you understand the work done.

The projects will help you gain idea about some key concepts of `Information Technology` and also the usage of some important tools and platforms. Below is the list of the sub-realms I touched ðŸ”½
> <mark>***NOTE***</mark> : Don't go too much into the sequence in which the "entities" are mentioned below. It's just a list for your reference.

 - ***Web Technologies***
 - ***Network and Information Security***
 - ***Advanced C Programming***
 - ***Database Management Systems***
 - ***Information Secuirty Management***
 - ***Information Security Analysis and Audit***
 - ***Open Source Programming***
 - ***Human Computer Interaction***
 - ***Machine Learning***
 - ***Artificial Intelligence***

> <mark>***NOTE***</mark> : More detailed information on what tools and platforms were used in each project is provided in the respective projects' documentation. Only those projects that contains the source code have detailed information about the same in the directory's `README` files.
<br>

I hope you can extract the most out of this repo. I will try to regularly update this repo's contents to make it more concise for you.

Thank You - Happy Learning !!!
