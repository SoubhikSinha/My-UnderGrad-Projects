# Under-Grad Project Repository
<br>

Hi all there !<br>

Welcome to my Under-Grad Project Repository. This is a store-house of all my projects carried out during my bachelor years at **[VIT University (Vellore, TN, IND)](https://vit.ac.in/)**.

This repo will be beneficial to those (*especially to sopohomores, juniors and seniors*) who have just started getting their hands dirty to learn something practically.

> <mark>***NOTE***</mark> : Most of the project's source code is not available because I realized too late that I needed to save it for future reference. Apologies for the inconvenience. However, you can still gain a lot from every project's documentation(s), which is concise and should help you understand the work done.

The projects will help you gain idea about some key concepts of `Information Technology` and also the usage of some important tools and platforms. Below is the list of the sub-realms I touched ðŸ”½

 - ***Web Technologies***
 - ***Network and Information Security***
 - ***Advanced C Programming***
 - ***Database Management Systems***
 - ***Information Secuirty Management***
 - ***Information Security Analysis and Audit***
 - ***Open Source Programming***
 - ***Human Computer Interaction***
 - ***Machine Learning***
 - ***Artificial Intelligence***

<br>

I hope you can extract the most out of this repo. I will try to regularly update it's contents to make it more useful for you.

Thank You - Happy Learning !!!
