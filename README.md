5.  <b>Significance</b> : Given the significant increase in credit card fraud cases globally, this research is crucial for identifying the most reliable methods for fraud detection, thereby enhancing security measures in digital transactions.

This project utilized a dataset [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) sourced from Kaggle, specifically provided by Google. This dataset contains records of approximately 284,807 transactions across European countries. Of these transactions, only 492 (0.17%) were identified as fraudulent, highlighting the imbalance between fraudulent and valid transactions. All features in the dataset are numerical, facilitating analysis using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. The 'Amount' feature represents the transaction amount and can be crucial for cost-sensitive learning, while the 'Class' feature serves as the response variable, taking the value 1 for fraud and 0 otherwise. The entire project was implemented in Python 3.9.4 within the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) [Python](https://www.python.org/) [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) environment using [Anaconda's](https://www.anaconda.com/) virtual environment. The columns labeled V1 to V28 in the dataset represent values resulting from [Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/principal-component-analysis-pca/). PCA is a method used for dimensionality reduction in datasets, originating from linear algebra. It transforms original variables into weighted linear combinations of those variables, capturing maximum variance while minimizing correlations between them. In PCA, [eigenvectors and eigenvalues](https://lpsa.swarthmore.edu/MtrxVibe/EigMat/MatrixEigen.html) derived from the covariance matrix of the original data are used to create new orthogonal components. An eigenvector of a linear transformation is a vector that changes only by a scalar factor when the transformation is applied, with the corresponding eigenvalue scaling the eigenvector. Among the models examined, `Artificial Neural Network (ANN)` achieved the `highest Accuracy` (<mark><b><u>`99.95%`</u></b></mark>), while `Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)` had the lowest (<mark><b><u>`93.65%`</u><b></mark>). `SVM` demonstrated the `highest Precision` (<mark><b><u>`100.00%`</u></b></mark>), and `ANN excelled in Recall` (<mark><b><u>`99.98%`</u></b></mark>) and `F1 Score` (<mark><b><u>`99.97%`</u></mark></b>). Overall, `ANN` proved to be the `most effective method`, showcasing superior performance in training, testing, and application. Future enhancements could focus on expanding datasets to further improve model accuracy, potentially reducing false positives and enhancing fraud detection capabilities significantly.

This project focuses on developing a method to anonymize facial images for privacy protection, particularly in the context of video surveillance. Traditional de-identification techniques, like <i>[blurring](https://medium.com/@kenrobbins/call-for-image-de-identification-standards-6b33e6576a12)</i> or <i>[black-boxing](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCVW_2019/papers/HBU/Yan_Attributes_Preserving_Face_De-Identification_ICCVW_2019_paper.pdf)</i>, are inadequate in preserving privacy without compromising image quality. The proposed method involves using blended facial composites to obscure identities while retaining key facial features. The project highlights the dramatic increase in data sharing online and the necessity for privacy protection against unauthorized access and misuse of facial images. The proposed model describes an approach to de-identifying images using a modified averaging technique and storing these images in a database. The method uses facial landmark detection to map key facial features. Implementation utilizes Python and the [dlib library](http://dlib.net/) to extract facial landmarks and apply the de-identification process, including specific functions for transforming images, color-coding features, and recognizing facial features. The results and discussion section compares the proposed method with traditional black-boxing, demonstrating superior performance in terms of non-detection accuracy by face recognition software. The proposed method achieves an `80%` accuracy rate of non-detection compared to `20%` for black-boxing. Additionally, the recovery function accurately reconstructs the original images with a [confidence level](https://machinelearningmastery.com/confidence-intervals-for-machine-learning/) of `85.08%` using the [Kairos tool](https://face.kairos.com/). The project concludes that the modified averaging technique effectively de-identifies and recovers images, outperforming traditional methods. Future work includes developing a transmission medium for secure image suppression and recovery. The project showcases an innovative approach to balancing privacy and image quality, with potential applications in surveillance and other areas requiring secure facial image handling.

### **[Masquerading Website Recognition Using Machine Learning Technique(s) Via Web-Browser](https://github.com/sricks404/My-UnderGrad-Projects/blob/main/Masquerading%20Website%20Recognition%20Using%20Machine%20Learning%20Technique(s)%20Via%20Web-Browser%20(Information%20Security%20Management).pdf) - Information Security ManagementðŸ”»**<br>

This project addresses the rising threat of [phishing](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/email-security/what-is-phishing.html) attacks targeting high-use websites such as those for banking and cloud storage by developing an intelligent, browser-based solution to protect user credentials. Utilizing a [Random Forest Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html), trained on a dataset of vulnerable websites through [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), the system can quickly and privately detect phishing sites directly within the browser, bypassing network delays and server dependencies. The aim is to create a lightweight browser plugin, leveraging [Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) for execution and reducing reliance on extensive machine learning libraries, to provide rapid detection and user alerts against phishing threats. Phishing, a prevalent [social engineering](https://www.ibm.com/topics/social-engineering#:~:text=Social%20engineering%20attacks%20manipulate%20people,their%20personal%20or%20organizational%20security.) attack, deceives users into disclosing sensitive information via fraudulent websites that mimic legitimate ones. Existing detection systems often rely on network-dependent features or incomplete blacklists. This project proposes a machine learning-based approach using URL characteristics to detect phishing sites and protect users by implementing the solution on the client side, enhancing speed and privacy. The project seeks to convert the underlying methodology into a Javascript-based browser plugin. Given Javascript's limitations with machine learning libraries, the solution must be efficient. The trained Random Forest model will be exported into a format usable by the browser to enable real-time phishing detection. The system trains the Random Forest classifier with features that can be extracted client-side, splits the dataset for training and testing, and exports the trained model to [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). The browser plugin uses this model to evaluate websites in real-time, alerting users if a site is deemed phishing. The solution focuses on being lightweight and quick for effective phishing detection. The implementation includes modules for data preprocessing, training, exporting the model, and frontend Javascript files (<i>Manifest.json, Background.js, Content.js</i>). The system was tested on various platforms ([Codetantra.com](https://www.codetantra.com/), [GitHub.com](https://github.com/), and a phishing site, [blockchain-tech.com](https://domains.atom.com/lpd/name/blockchain-tech.com)) and delivered an `accuracy` of `94.66%`. A comparative study showed our systemâ€™s efficiency against existing systems, achieving the best `accuracy` of `97.36%`, with an [F-measure](https://deepchecks.com/glossary/f-score/#:~:text=The%20F%2Dscore%20(also%20known,)%20%2F%20(precision%20%2B%20recall)) of `0.974` and `ROC` area of `0.996`. Future enhancements could include using more features without compromising speed, caching frequent results, employing Worker Threads for faster classification, and ensuring stored results do not increase susceptibility to pharming attacks.
