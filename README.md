# Under-Grad Project Repository
Hi all there !
Welcome to my Under-Grad Project Repository. This is a store-house of all my projects I carried out during my bachelor years at **[VIT University (Vellore, TN, IND)](https://vit.ac.in/)**.

This repo will be beneficial to those (*especially to sopohomores, juniors and seniors*) who have just started getting their hands dirty to learn something practically.

> <mark>***NOTE***</mark> : Most of the project's source codes are not available because I figured out way later than I should have that, I needed to save them for future reference. Thus, apologies in advance ! But you can still extract a lot of the abovementioned from the project's documentation - they are pretty brief to help you understand with clarity.

The projects will help you understand some key concepts of Computer Science and also the usage of some important tools and platforms. Below is the list of the same ðŸ”½
