- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) : 
It is the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors). Residuals are a measure of how far from the regression line data points are; RMSE is a measure of how spread out these residuals are. In other words, it tells you how concentrated the data is around the line of best fit.

- R-Square (R2) score : 
“(total variance explained by model) / total variance.” So if it is 100%, the two variables are perfectly correlated, i.e., with no variance at all. A low value would show a low level of correlation, meaning a regression model that is not valid, but not in all cases. Here, the two variables can be assumed to be the testing data values and predicted data values.

NOTE 💥 : Higher R2 score and lower RMSE score --> Better Model

- SVR (Support Vector Regression) : Support Vector Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that is used to predict discrete values. Support Vector Regression uses the same principle as the SVMs. The basic idea behind SVR is to find the best fit line. In SVR, the best fit line is the hyperplane that has the maximum number of points.

- PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) : The process of finding optimal values for the specific parameters of a given system to fulfill all 
design requirements while considering the lowest possible cost is referred to as an optimization. PSO uses a number of particles (agents) that constitute a swarm moving around in the search space, looking for the best solution. Each particle in the swarm looks for its positional coordinates in the solution space, which are associated with the best solution that has been achieved so far by that particle. It is known as pbest or personal best.

- ARIMA : An autoregressive integrated moving average, or ARIMA, is a statistical analysis model that uses time series data to either better understand the data set or to predict future trends.

- ANN (Artificial Neural Network) : Usually called neural networks (NNs) or neural nets, they are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains (Neurons).

- ACF (Auto-Correlation Function) : 
The autocorrelation function is a statistical representation used to analyze the degree of similarity between a time series and a lagged 
version of itself. This function allows the analyst to compare the current value of a data set to its past value. To use this function, the analyst uses the same time series and compares it against a lagged version of itself over one or more time periods. They assess the strength of the correlation between these different versions to uncover trends and patterns that allow them to evaluate the strength of the relationship between two or more variables.

- PACF (Partial Auto-Correlation Function) :
In time series analysis, the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) gives the partial correlation of a stationary time series with its own
lagged values, regressed the values of the time series at all shorter lags. It contrasts with the autocorrelation function, which does not 
control for other lags.

- Adaptive Fourier Decomposition (AFD) : 
The Fourier decomposition is the classical tool for decomposing a given surface or more generally a signal into its basic components. Using Fourier decomposition the surface is broken down into different scales using a set of sine and cosine functions with different frequencies. AFD uses adaptive basis to achieve the fast energy convergence.

- Metaheuristics are strategies that guide the search process. The goal is to efficiently explore the search space in order to find near–optimal solutions.

- Fourier analysis converts a signal from its original domain (often time or space) to a representation in the frequency domain and vice versa.

- Sine Cosine Optimization : The algorithm generates various initial random solutions and asks them to shift towards the best solution using a mathematical model based on sine and cosine functions.

- Holt-Winters exponential smoothing : 
The Holt-Winters method uses exponential smoothing to encode lots of values from the past and use them to predict “typical” values for the 
present and future. Exponential smoothing refers to the use of an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) to “smooth” a time series.

- Fruit fly optimization process : 
The fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) was a meta-heuristic algorithm which is inspired by the foraging behavior of fruit fly. Fruit fly relies on vision and smell to position food during foraging. FOA searches for solution space by mimicking the way of fruit fly flight when solving optimization problems.

- The genetic algorithm (GA) is a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems that is based on natural selection, the process that drives biological evolution. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are used to optimize free parameters of SVR. The experimental results indicate that GA-SVR can achieve better forecasting accuracy and performance than traditional SVR and artificial neural network (ANN) prediction models.

- Temporal Aggregation (MTA) : The situation in which a variable that evolves through time can not be observed at all dates.

- Multiple Aggregation Prediction Algorithm (MAPA) : MAPA can be seen as a three step procedure, where in the first step the original time series is aggregated in multiple aggregation levels using non-overlapping means of length k. The mean is used instead of the sum, as it retains the scale of the series across the various aggregation levels. 

- Hierarchical forecasting :  It is the process of generating coherent forecasts (or reconciling incoherent forecasts) that allows individual time series to be forecasted individually while still preserving the relationships within the hierarchy.

- Cross-sectional refers to hierarchies that include different time series of the same sampling frequency across various demarcations, such as product categories, geographical regions, variable components, etc.

- (Flaw) MTA & MAPA : the exact demand from a specific region can't be ascertained, because it is aggregated.

- Quantile Random Forest : Quantile regression forests (QRF) is an extension of random forests that provides non-parametric estimates of the median predicted value as well as prediction quantiles. It therefore allows spatially explicit non-parametric estimates of model uncertainty.

- Bagging and Boosting Methods : Bagging is used when our objective is to reduce the variance of a decision tree. Here the concept is to create a few subsets of data from the training sample, which is chosen randomly with replacement. Now each collection of subset data is used to prepare their decision trees thus, we end up with an ensemble of various models. The average of all the assumptions from numerous tress is used, which is more powerful than a single decision tree. Boosting is another ensemble procedure to make a collection of predictors. In other words, we fit consecutive trees, usually random samples, and at each step, the objective is to solve net error from the prior trees.

⚡PROPOSED METHODOLOGY 🔽
--------------------------
- An optimizer is an algorithm or function that adapts the neural network's attributes, like learning rate and weights.

- 

- Why using MinMaxScaler ?
1. When the upper and lower boundaries are well known from domain knowledge.
2. Scales all the data features in the range [0, 1] or else in the range [-1, 1] if there are negative values in the dataset.
3. Guarantees all features will have the exact same scale

- Keras
Keras is an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library.Keras is a high-level, deep learning API developed by Google for implementing neural networks. It is written in Python and is used to make the implementation of neural networks easy. It also supports multiple backend neural network computation.

- Keras vs Tensorflow
TensorFlow is an open-sourced end-to-end platform, a library for multiple machine learning tasks, while Keras is a high-level neural network library that runs on top of TensorFlow. Both provide high-level APIs used for easily building and training models, but Keras is more user-friendly because it's built-in Python.

- 3-Dimensional data
1. The batch size is a number of samples processed before the model is updated. The number of epochs is the number of complete passes through the training dataset. The size of a batch must be more than or equal to one and less than or equal to the number of samples in the training dataset.
2. A time step is a single occurrence of the cell
3. input dimension / input shape : the term says it all

- Rolling Statistics
A rolling average continuously updates the average of a data set to include all the data in the set until that point.

- Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test
Augmented Dickey Fuller test (ADF Test) is a common statistical test used to test whether a given Time series is stationary or not. It is one of the most commonly used statistical test when it comes to analyzing the stationary of a series.


>> De-trending data 🔻(Below 4 only)

➡️ BoxCox Transformation
Box-Cox transformation is a statistical technique that transforms your target variable so that your data closely resembles a normal distribution.

➡️ Logarithmic Transformation
The log transformation is often used where the data has a positively skewed distribution (shown below) and there are a few very large values. If these large values are located in your study area, the log transformation will help make the variances more constant and normalize your data.

➡️ Removing trend using Moving Average
A moving average smoothes a series by consolidating the a days' data-points into longer units of time—namely an average of several days' data.

➡️ Exponential (Decay) transformation
An exponential transformation is a simple algebraic transformation of a monomial function through variable substitution with an exponential variable.



- ACF (Auto-Correlation Function)
It defines how data points in a time series are related, on average, to the preceding data points. In other words, it measures the self-similarity of the signal over different delay times.

- PACF (Partial ACF)
It gives the partial correlation of a stationary time series with its own lagged values, regressed the values of the time series at all shorter lags. It contrasts with the autocorrelation function, which does not control for other lags.

☠️NOTE : The “I” stands for integrated in ARIMA, which means that the data is stationary.

- Regression equation : It is used in stats to find out what relationship, if any, exists between sets of data.


NOTE : For all other components uncovered here - are properly explained in the doc
